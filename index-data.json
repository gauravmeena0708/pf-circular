Direct UAN Allotment and Activation\n2. UAN Activation for Existing UANs\n3. Face Authentication Service for Existing Activated UANs\n\nFor availing this facility, the only requirement would be to download the UMANG App\nand Aadhaar Face RD App from Playstore. The above facility can be availed by the\nMembers themselves using their smartphones without any intervention of\nEPFO/Employers. Facility is also available for downloading e-UAN card PDF for handing\nover to Employer for onboarding with EPFO.\n\nThe benefits that would accrue to members using FAT include foolproof validation of\nAadhaar data as all data of user is pre-populated directly from Aadhaar database and\ncompletion of UAN activation process during UAN generation itself. There would be no\nrequirement for initiation of UAN activation process afresh. By availing this facility\nmember would gain immediate access to EPFO services such as passbook viewing, KYC\nupdates, claim submission etc.\n\nA detailed User Manual in this regard is enclosed herewith.\n\n[This has the approval of CPFC]\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n7 e\\y\\sa¥,\nG.

Therefore, now onwards all\nROs shall process pension claims with any bank account of any branch of any\nscheduled commercial bank anywhere in India and shall act as CPPS enabled offices.\n\n2: Accordingly, there should not be any transfer out of PPO due to branch of the\nbank in which the pensioner has the account, being located outside the jurisdiction of\nthe concerned RO or the bank not having pension disbursement agreement with the\nconcerned RO. While processing pension claim, any such new branch/bank shall be\nmandatorily added in bank master with its IFSC and the required data fields of Pension\nPayment Disbursement Account Number & Service charge disbursement Account\nNumber values as zero for such new entries in the system.\n\n3. The member applying for pension claim may be informed that they can also\nchoose same bank account number as per their UAN-KYC used for PF claim in pension\nclaim also. It is advisable to avoid failure/wrong payment due to bank account related\nerrors.\n\n4. It is reiterated that due care shall be taken while entering IFSC and\nbank account details of beneficiaries for processing of pension claims. The\nconcerned section shall process the claim accordingly.\n\n5; The PPOs for cases included in CPPS are required to be sent only to concerned\npensioners and not to the branch. For all such cases, an undertaking in the attached\nformat shall also be taken from the pensioners within one month of receiving pension\nclaim. For offline claims (e.g. death cases) the undertaking may be taken with claim\nitself.\n\n6. Also, it must be ensured that for all new PPOs issued, Aadhaar must be seeded\nin the system for all the beneficiaries so that in future, there would be no issue in DLC\nsubmission for the pensioner. All ROs are advised to submit Aadhar details of the\nbeneficiaries at the time of pension claims and to make sure that pension would start\nonly after having the details of Aadhar of beneficiaries in the system.",

In this regard, it is informed that the existing standard budget heads (list at Annexure\nB) in relation to the expenditure on administration of Funds are proposed to be replaced with a\nnew set of budget heads, which has been formulated closely along the lines of object heads\nused in the Govt of India. The new budget heads and sub-budget heads along with their\n\ndescription are detailed at Annexure C, and are expected to be made operational from the next\nFY, ie. FY 2025-26.\n\nUnder this new structure, each budget head is sub divided into one or multiple sub budget\nheads, representing the broad components that make up the budget head. This will provide a\nmore detailed accounting of expenditures and will also facilitate preparation of more structured\nand realistic budgetary estimates for each budget head.\n\n3: Expenditures will be recorded under both the relevant budget head and the appropriate\nsub-budget head. However, appropriations for expenditures will be allocated at the budget head\n\nlevel, not the sub-budget head level. As a result, an appropriation under a budget head can be\nused to cover expenses across any of the sub-budget heads within that budget head.",

Some of the zones have forwarded the proposal also, however, it is found that in most of the\nproposals there are some discrepancies, which are mentioned below: -\n\n(i) DPC is not recommending the official who have refused the promotion on earlier occasion and\nnot completing 1 year of service as on 01.01.2025 but completing the same in the duration of\n01.01.2025 to 31.12.2025.\n\nGuidelines on the issue: -\n\nIn this connection, para 17.12 of DoPT OM dated 10.04.1989 says \"When a Government employee does\nnot want to accept a promotion which is offered to him he may make a written request that he may not\nbe promoted and the request will be considered by the appointing authority, taking relevant aspects\ninto consideration, If the reasons adduced for refusal of promotion are acceptable to the appointing\nauthority, the next person in the select list may be promoted. However, since it may not be\nadministratively possible or desirable to offer appointment to the persons who initially refused\npromotion, on every occasion on which a vacancy arises, during the period of validity of the panel, no\nfresh offer of appointment on promotion shall be made in such cases for a period of one year from the\ndate of refusal of first promotion or till a next vacancy arises whichever is later. \"\n\nUnder para-17.12 of the DOPT OM dated the 10\" April, 1989, there is no bar for consideration of\nGovernment servants for promotion by the DPC who have refused promotion offered on the basis of\nthe recommendations of the previous DPC. The relevant instructions only forbid fresh offer of\nappointment on promotion to be made to such persons during the validity of the panel and further for a\nperiod of one year from the date of refusal of first promotion or till a next vacancy arises. DPCs are\nmisinterpreting the relevant instructions. Role of the DPC it to assess the suitability of the employee as\nto whether he is \"fit' or 'not fit for promotion on the basis of information provided to it. This is for the\nAppointing Authority to issue offer of appointment on the recommendations of DPC.\n\nIn view of the above, it is imperative for the DPC to assess the suitability of the officals who have\n\nrefused for promotion, irrespective of the fact he had refused to accept the offer of promotion based on\nthe recommendations of earlier DPC. However, he would be issued offer of appointment on promotion\n\na",

This will in the long run, reduce dependence of\nthe pensioners on banks and other intermediaries for updation of DLCs.\n\nThe details of the actions to be taken are as follows:\n\nA.) Actions to be taken by each Field Office\n1. Involve Pension Disbursing Banks:\n\nThe role of the pension disbursing banks is critical because they are the first point of contact\nfor pensioners seeking pension or for updating their life certificates. As per agreement with\nbanks, they are required to make adequate arrangements for the updation of life certificates.\nAccordingly, they are required to deploy Fingerprint Scanners and Iris Scanners. The bank\nbranches need to display prominently the facility of Face Authentication and the steps\ninvolved in it. Especially, for those pensioners whose Fingerprints or Iris is not capturable\ndue to any reason, the facility must be provided to update their digital life certificate through\nFace Authentication. They shall also educate the pensioners about using their own mobile\nphones for DLC updation so that in future they need not come to the banks and may do the\nDLC sitting in the comfort of their home.\n\nIn the case where Fingerprint or Iris authentication or Facial recognition is not\n\nfeasible for any reason, the bank may issue physical life certificate in such exceptional cases\nafter due verification as deemed fit to ensure that pension is disbursed to such pensioners also\n\nwithout delay.\nAll the field offices shall take up this issue in the monthly meeting with the Pension\nDisbursing banks to ensure that the objective is clearly understood and met.\n\n2. Information Dissemination to Employers/unions:\n\nField offices should send emails and hold awareness sessions with employers associations\nand all employees unions operating under the jurisdiction of ROs for the dissemination of\nface authentication facility for DLC updation.",

One of the prime reasons identified for the\nsame is improper handling of the Phone calls on.the Telephone at the PRO.\n\nInstances of calls going unanswered, incorrect details of the PRO and telephone\nnumbers on the website, causal handling of the calls with general replies as well as\nnon-logical addressing of the member query have been noticed leaving member\nexperience a regrettable one.\n\nAs such the Public Relations officer has to ensure that channel of communication is\nnot impeded with the visitors as well as on the calls coming on the PRO Telephone.\nTo ensure the same, the following set of guidelines has to be adhered to optimize\nservice quality and responsiveness: -\n\na. Caller ID-enabled Telephone numbers are provided at the PRO with\nTelephone numbers at the PRO updated and details of the PRO along with all\nthe telephone numbers at the PRO are mentioned on the EPFO Website. It\nhas to be ensured that the phones remain operational during working hours\nand technical disruptions have to be attended promptly to avoid\ncommunication breakdowns.\n\nb. The calls on the telephones are attended to promptly and properly. PROs are\nexpected to answer all incoming calls courteously and professionally,\nproviding a positive first impression of the EPFO.",

PRAYAAS is one\nsuch initiative, which was launched on 21.07.2020 with an aim of handing over\nPPOs to members of EPS 1995 on the day of their superannuation.\n\n2. To ensure success of the initiatives ZOs and ROs have been advised to\nconduct webinars with employers and such EPS, 1995 members, who are\nsuperannuating within three months. The purpose of these Webinars is to educate\nthe members of the EPS, 1995 and their employers so that they can submit the\nPension claims complete in all respects in advance. ZOs and ROs were also being\nprovided the list of EPS, 1995 members, who were about to superannuate to\nfacilitate further actions at their end.\n\n3. However, upon review it is seen that the progress in this direction is still far\nfrom satisfactory and field offices need to take pro-active actions to maximize the\nnumber of cases under PRAYAAS.\n\n4. To ensure significant progress the ZOs and ROs may note and act upon the\nfollowing points:\n\ne A Dashboard on PRAYAAS Initiative has been deployed in MIS 3.0 on\n04.06.2024. The ZOs/ROs shall use this dashboard to focus on the\nemployees due to superannuate.\n\ne Webinars must be conducted with the EPS, 1995 members due to retire at\nthe age of 58 years / 60 years and their employers for guiding them to\nsubmit pension claim in advance at ZO as well as at RO",

Accordingly,\npensioners will have to submit their Life Certificate/ Jeevan Pramaan during the\nsame month in the next year also failing which pension would be stopped from\nthe succeeding month.\n\n2. However, it has been observed that 449288 number of Life\nCertificates are pending for updation as on 19.06.2023 for more than three\nyears. Updation of Life Certificates in our application software is important for\nensuring continued disbursement of pension without any stoppage or breaks and\nto avoid any undue harassment or problems for the pensioners.\n\na, In light of the significantly large number of Digital Life Certificates ,\n(DLCs) pending for updation for more than three years, it is imperative to\ninitiate proactive actions for bridging the gap of pensions who are not receiving\npension by updating DLCs pending for more than three years. To this end, a\nmonth long special drive is initiated w.e.f. 20.06.2024 where newly recruited\nSocial Security Assistants (SSAs) will visit the concerned pensioners under the\nguidance of their mentors to provide doorstep services to pensioners using this\nApp and facilitate submission of pending DLCs.\n\n4. The detailed process for the said drive is as below:\n\nI. Creation of groups: Each group of uptoi0 SSAs would have one mentor\nof AO/EO level who will guide them in their field visit.\n\nII. Identification of pending DLCs: Regional Offices will compile list of\nDLCs that have been pending for more than three years through MIS 3.0.\nThis list should include relevant details such as pensioners’ name,\naddress, contact information, and the duration of pending DLC. The fist\nmay be sorted Pin code wise.\n\nIII. Training and Guidance: The Nodal Officers will train and guide the\nnewly recruited SSAs and equip them with the necessary skills and\nknowledge to effectively communicate with pensioners and process to\nupdate the DLC online. It may be ensured that the assigned SSAs are as\nmuch as possible well versed with the local language of the area.",

CPFCs, Zonal Offices\nAll RPFCs/OICs, Regional offices\n\nSub: Assistance to members/ beneficiaries in filing Pension claims at PRO\n- Reg.\n\nMadam/Sir,\n\nWhile EPFO has moved towards online claim filing and speedier\nsettlement of claims, there is urgent need to focus on getting the claims complete\nin all form, from the members, on due basis.\n\n2. To attain this objective a dashboard for Pension as well as EDLI & PF (death\ncases), on due basis, has already been provided so that ROs may take these cases\nup with the employers and the employees for getting the claims.\n\n3. Apart from the target of receiving the claims on due basis there is another\nimportant target of reducing the rejections. Needless to say that rejections not .\nonly cause grievances from members/beneficiaries but also results into lot of man\nhours being wasted on unproductive work.\n\n4. It has been found that claims are rejected many a time due to reasons which\ncan be avoided by guiding the members in filing claims, educating them, about the\nreasons which causes rejection and facilitating them in fulfilling the requirements\nof a claim form.\n\n5. Therefore, since PRO is the interface between the Field Office and its\nmembers/ beneficiaries, its role in guiding and educating members/ beneficiaries\nis of utmost importance. ROs are therefore, advised to strengthen their PRO and\nundertake following activities:\n\ni. For the information of members/ beneficiaries the checklist of requirements\nwhile filing claim should be displayed in PRO prominently.\n\nii. Specialized Desk shall be created in PRO by suitably posting Dealing\nAssistants for providing assistance to members/beneficiaries in online claim\nfiling.\n\niii. Efforts shall be taken to obtain claims online as much as possible. However,\nin cases where online filing of claim may not be possible, Dealing Assistant",

However, some of the employees do not accept promotion/posting\norders; instead make representation refusing the promotion.

The refusal of\npromotion by the employees is not only counter-productive but also detrimental to the smooth\n\nfunctioning of the Organization.\n\npe The cases of refusal of promotion are increasing and hence to tackle the issue,\n\nfollowing guidelines are being framed for strict compliance, which are as under: -\n\n(A) The refusal request may first be considered by a Committee constituted at ZO Level\nbefore being referred to the Appointing Authority for a final decision. The composition of the\n\ncommittee at ZO level for the above purpose may be as under: -\n\nComposition of the Committee at Zonal Level: ACC (HQ)/ACC of the Zone, RPFC-I\nof the Zonal Office/senior most RPFC-I and OIC of the concerned RO (where the employee is\n\nposted before promotion).",

In this regard, your kind attention is invited to the page number 179 of Manual of\nAccounting Procedure Part-II-A and II-B dealing with the procedure of transfer of account after\nthe death of the member — prescribes as follows:\n\n“11.9 Where a Provident Fund account has not been transferred during the life time of\nthe member on account of non-submission of transfer application or for any other\nreason, and if it is brought to the notice of Regional Provident Fund Commissioner\nabout the earlier Provident Fund membership, the Regional Provident Fund\nCommissioner may arrange to get the account transferred from other Regional\nOffice/Sub-Regional Offices without insisting for a transfer application and settle the\ndeceased member’s account.”\n\n4, Further attention is also invited to EDLI notification CG-DL-E29042021-226788 dated\n28.04.2021 circulated vide Head Office letter No.27058 dated 29.04.2021. As per the\namended EDLI Scheme continuous services of 12 months rendered with two different\nestablishments shall also be counted for the purpose of calculating EDLI benefits. However this\nshall be possible only when the previous membership of the deceased worker is transferred to\nthe present PF account.",

Applying the principle of a Regional Office having not more than 7.5\nLakhs Contributory memberships in any office, it would require at least 11 offices (Existing\nNo. of ROs are 9) in the two Zones. As per the criteria mentioned in para 8 and para 9 of the\nAgenda Item No 10 placed before 103 EC Meeting dated 19.10.2022 re-distribution of the\nworkload would be done among the existing Regional Offices sharing common jurisdiction or\nto other Regional Offices with geographically contiguous jurisdiction or by carving out a new\nRegional Office from the existing Offices for ensuring equitable and manageable distribution\nof workload.\n\n2. On the basis of this approval, the boundaries of Regional Offices of Bandra and Thane\nZones (now renamed as Mumbai & Thane Zones) have been rationalized to align with\ndistrict boundaries of Mumbai City, Mumbai Sub-urban and Thane districts. To adjust this,\nsome offices have marginally higher membership which can be handled without difficulty.\nThis is being done by opening of 2 new Regional Offices and re-organising the workload\namong 11 Regional Offices. In addition, 2 new District Offices are being opened to address\nthe interests and aspirations of the stakeholders and increase the efficiency of service\ndelivery to the members of these areas.\n\n3.

The following points shall be kept in mind while conducting the Special Recovery Drive:\n\na) Maximum number of Officers, as far as practicable, shall be detailed to carry out such\ndrive without disturbing other functional areas. The Officers before proceeding in the\nmatter shall gather all information like details of bank accounts, details of sundry debtors\netc. from the records available in the office and also from third party sources like Income\nTax Department, Inspector of Factories and Boilers, Inspector of Shops and\nEstablishments, Employees’ State Insurance Corporation, Regional Transport\nAuthorities, Industries and Commerce Departments, Industrial Estates, Local Bodies, Co-\noperative Department, Director of Mining and Geology, Employers’ Associations, Trade\nUnions etc.\n\nb) RPFCS In-charge of Regional Offices shall closely monitor the progress of recovery\n\nduring the currency of the drive. Since, all the Regional Offices have already intimated\ntheir targets for recovery to Head Office, efforts should be made by the Field Offices for\n\nachieving these targets.\n\nc) Wide publicity shall be given to the Special Recovery Drive through local News\nPapers, display on the notice boards of the Office, through Employers’ Associations and\nTrade Unions.",

With reference to the facility in the software to mark the attached offices, it is\ninformed that the HR software allows the generation of salary from the Regional\nOffices only apart from the Head Office and PDNASS with its ZTIs. As the Zonal Office\nVijayawada was opened in a different city from Guntur, this Zonal Office is having\nfacility to draw salary themselves. For all other Zones the salary of the ACC (HQ)/ACC/\nRPFC-I/ RPFC-II posted in a ZO and of the APFC /RPFC-II posted in a District Office,\nis drawn by the Regional Office and so their posting is also recorded in the Regional\nOffice.\n\nThe Vigilance Directorate, the Zonal Vigilance Offices, Zonal Offices and the\nDistrict Offices are shown as attached offices of concerned Regional Office/ASD (HO)\nin HR Soft. The concerned Regional Offices may add the Officer for salary in these\naforementioned offices along-with utilizing facility in the software to mark the attached\noffices. Accordingly, it should be ensured that the Officers posted in Zonal\nOffices/District Offices/Vigilance Directorate/Zonal Vigilance Offices are appropriately\nmarked so that the vacancy and incumbency in a Zone or District Office is correctly\nshown. A copy of the User Manual is attached.\n\n4. Further, it was observed during the previous AGTs that in some of the\nbifurcated offices, few officers were shown as posted in the pre-bifurcated office. It\nshould be ensured that correct office is entered in the HR-Soft and such discrepancies,\nif any, should be rectified.\n\nPage 1 of 3",

The Theme for the VAW 2023 declared by CVC is:\n\n“STSeTay oT fatter Hi; Wee w ula walter we”\n\n“Say no to corruption; commit to the Nation”\n\nAs a precursor to the Week, there is a 03 months Vigilance Awareness Campaign from\n16\" August to 15 November 2023. In its endeavour to improve transparency and\naccountability of its officials, EPFO, has as always looked forward to observing the\nVigilance Awareness Week and Campaign with meaning and enthusiasm. The focus areas\nof Vigilance Awareness Campaign 2023 are:\n\n« Awareness building about Public Interest Disclosure and Protection of Informers\n(PIDPI) Resolution\n\nCapacity Building programmes\n\nidentification and implementation of Systemic Improvement measures\nLeveraging IT for Complaint disposal\n\nUpdation of Circulars/Guidelines/manuals\n\nDisposal of complaints received before 30.06.2023\n\nKeeping the objective of a more vigilant EPFO at the forefront, it is felt that this is the right\noccasion to urge all concerned to strictly follow the CVC guidelines and HO. instructions in\nletter and spirit, so that actions are as per rule and we send a strong message to the corrupt\nand deter their unethical activities.\n\nIt is with pride to inform you that in the VAW 2022 celebrations, EPFO had found a place\nof recognition in the 50\" edition of the VIGEYE VANI, a Special Newsletter of the CVC. As\npart of the Commission's campaign on housekeeping activities and record management,\nEPFO could remove 96000 old unused files and closed more than 2700 e-files, which\nshows EPFO’s commitment to maintaining a well orgainsed system. The exercise also\ngenerated revenue of nearly Rs 19 Lakhs for which EPFO was amongst the Top 5",
