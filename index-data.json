Direct UAN Allotment and Activation\n2. UAN Activation for Existing UANs\n3. Face Authentication Service for Existing Activated UANs\n\nFor availing this facility, the only requirement would be to download the UMANG App\nand Aadhaar Face RD App from Playstore. The above facility can be availed by the\nMembers themselves using their smartphones without any intervention of\nEPFO/Employers. Facility is also available for downloading e-UAN card PDF for handing\nover to Employer for onboarding with EPFO.\n\nThe benefits that would accrue to members using FAT include foolproof validation of\nAadhaar data as all data of user is pre-populated directly from Aadhaar database and\ncompletion of UAN activation process during UAN generation itself. There would be no\nrequirement for initiation of UAN activation process afresh. By availing this facility\nmember would gain immediate access to EPFO services such as passbook viewing, KYC\nupdates, claim submission etc.\n\nA detailed User Manual in this regard is enclosed herewith.\n\n[This has the approval of CPFC]\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n7 e\\y\\sa¥,\nG.

The matter has been examined and although the filing of the ECR and remittance of dues\nthrough internet banking should be the preferred mode of remittance, not allowing the employer\nto remit the employee contribution deducted from the employees’ wages and employer\ncontribution should be avoided.\n\n3.
