Direct UAN Allotment and Activation\n2. UAN Activation for Existing UANs\n3. Face Authentication Service for Existing Activated UANs\n\nFor availing this facility, the only requirement would be to download the UMANG App\nand Aadhaar Face RD App from Playstore. The above facility can be availed by the\nMembers themselves using their smartphones without any intervention of\nEPFO/Employers. Facility is also available for downloading e-UAN card PDF for handing\nover to Employer for onboarding with EPFO.\n\nThe benefits that would accrue to members using FAT include foolproof validation of\nAadhaar data as all data of user is pre-populated directly from Aadhaar database and\ncompletion of UAN activation process during UAN generation itself. There would be no\nrequirement for initiation of UAN activation process afresh. By availing this facility\nmember would gain immediate access to EPFO services such as passbook viewing, KYC\nupdates, claim submission etc.\n\nA detailed User Manual in this regard is enclosed herewith.\n\n[This has the approval of CPFC]\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n7 e\\y\\sa¥,\nG.

Therefore, now onwards all\nROs shall process pension claims with any bank account of any branch of any\nscheduled commercial bank anywhere in India and shall act as CPPS enabled offices.\n\n2: Accordingly, there should not be any transfer out of PPO due to branch of the\nbank in which the pensioner has the account, being located outside the jurisdiction of\nthe concerned RO or the bank not having pension disbursement agreement with the\nconcerned RO. While processing pension claim, any such new branch/bank shall be\nmandatorily added in bank master with its IFSC and the required data fields of Pension\nPayment Disbursement Account Number & Service charge disbursement Account\nNumber values as zero for such new entries in the system.\n\n3. The member applying for pension claim may be informed that they can also\nchoose same bank account number as per their UAN-KYC used for PF claim in pension\nclaim also. It is advisable to avoid failure/wrong payment due to bank account related\nerrors.\n\n4. It is reiterated that due care shall be taken while entering IFSC and\nbank account details of beneficiaries for processing of pension claims. The\nconcerned section shall process the claim accordingly.\n\n5; The PPOs for cases included in CPPS are required to be sent only to concerned\npensioners and not to the branch. For all such cases, an undertaking in the attached\nformat shall also be taken from the pensioners within one month of receiving pension\nclaim. For offline claims (e.g. death cases) the undertaking may be taken with claim\nitself.\n\n6. Also, it must be ensured that for all new PPOs issued, Aadhaar must be seeded\nin the system for all the beneficiaries so that in future, there would be no issue in DLC\nsubmission for the pensioner. All ROs are advised to submit Aadhar details of the\nbeneficiaries at the time of pension claims and to make sure that pension would start\nonly after having the details of Aadhar of beneficiaries in the system.",

In this regard, it is informed that the existing standard budget heads (list at Annexure\nB) in relation to the expenditure on administration of Funds are proposed to be replaced with a\nnew set of budget heads, which has been formulated closely along the lines of object heads\nused in the Govt of India. The new budget heads and sub-budget heads along with their\n\ndescription are detailed at Annexure C, and are expected to be made operational from the next\nFY, ie. FY 2025-26.\n\nUnder this new structure, each budget head is sub divided into one or multiple sub budget\nheads, representing the broad components that make up the budget head. This will provide a\nmore detailed accounting of expenditures and will also facilitate preparation of more structured\nand realistic budgetary estimates for each budget head.\n\n3: Expenditures will be recorded under both the relevant budget head and the appropriate\nsub-budget head. However, appropriations for expenditures will be allocated at the budget head\n\nlevel, not the sub-budget head level. As a result, an appropriation under a budget head can be\nused to cover expenses across any of the sub-budget heads within that budget head.",

Some of the zones have forwarded the proposal also, however, it is found that in most of the\nproposals there are some discrepancies, which are mentioned below: -\n\n(i) DPC is not recommending the official who have refused the promotion on earlier occasion and\nnot completing 1 year of service as on 01.01.2025 but completing the same in the duration of\n01.01.2025 to 31.12.2025.\n\nGuidelines on the issue: -\n\nIn this connection, para 17.12 of DoPT OM dated 10.04.1989 says \"When a Government employee does\nnot want to accept a promotion which is offered to him he may make a written request that he may not\nbe promoted and the request will be considered by the appointing authority, taking relevant aspects\ninto consideration, If the reasons adduced for refusal of promotion are acceptable to the appointing\nauthority, the next person in the select list may be promoted. However, since it may not be\nadministratively possible or desirable to offer appointment to the persons who initially refused\npromotion, on every occasion on which a vacancy arises, during the period of validity of the panel, no\nfresh offer of appointment on promotion shall be made in such cases for a period of one year from the\ndate of refusal of first promotion or till a next vacancy arises whichever is later. \"\n\nUnder para-17.12 of the DOPT OM dated the 10\" April, 1989, there is no bar for consideration of\nGovernment servants for promotion by the DPC who have refused promotion offered on the basis of\nthe recommendations of the previous DPC. The relevant instructions only forbid fresh offer of\nappointment on promotion to be made to such persons during the validity of the panel and further for a\nperiod of one year from the date of refusal of first promotion or till a next vacancy arises. DPCs are\nmisinterpreting the relevant instructions. Role of the DPC it to assess the suitability of the employee as\nto whether he is \"fit' or 'not fit for promotion on the basis of information provided to it. This is for the\nAppointing Authority to issue offer of appointment on the recommendations of DPC.\n\nIn view of the above, it is imperative for the DPC to assess the suitability of the officals who have\n\nrefused for promotion, irrespective of the fact he had refused to accept the offer of promotion based on\nthe recommendations of earlier DPC. However, he would be issued offer of appointment on promotion\n\na",

This will in the long run, reduce dependence of\nthe pensioners on banks and other intermediaries for updation of DLCs.\n\nThe details of the actions to be taken are as follows:\n\nA.) Actions to be taken by each Field Office\n1. Involve Pension Disbursing Banks:\n\nThe role of the pension disbursing banks is critical because they are the first point of contact\nfor pensioners seeking pension or for updating their life certificates. As per agreement with\nbanks, they are required to make adequate arrangements for the updation of life certificates.\nAccordingly, they are required to deploy Fingerprint Scanners and Iris Scanners. The bank\nbranches need to display prominently the facility of Face Authentication and the steps\ninvolved in it. Especially, for those pensioners whose Fingerprints or Iris is not capturable\ndue to any reason, the facility must be provided to update their digital life certificate through\nFace Authentication. They shall also educate the pensioners about using their own mobile\nphones for DLC updation so that in future they need not come to the banks and may do the\nDLC sitting in the comfort of their home.\n\nIn the case where Fingerprint or Iris authentication or Facial recognition is not\n\nfeasible for any reason, the bank may issue physical life certificate in such exceptional cases\nafter due verification as deemed fit to ensure that pension is disbursed to such pensioners also\n\nwithout delay.\nAll the field offices shall take up this issue in the monthly meeting with the Pension\nDisbursing banks to ensure that the objective is clearly understood and met.\n\n2. Information Dissemination to Employers/unions:\n\nField offices should send emails and hold awareness sessions with employers associations\nand all employees unions operating under the jurisdiction of ROs for the dissemination of\nface authentication facility for DLC updation.",
